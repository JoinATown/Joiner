We believe that in order to solve this problem is necessary making financial more inclusive. Actually, most of the communities doesn’t trust on financial institutions, some of them fear banks. From the customer perspective, transparency and trust is essential. As a consequence, some people choose not to get involved with financial institutions and use informal services.
